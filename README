Yet Another JSON Parser for DotNet 4.0
--------------------------------------

This is a simple and handy JSON parser adopted from Shawn Weisfeld (http://bit.ly/jPqVsQ) code. It uses Dynamic type that has been introduced in .Net 4.0. I have added an extension function to string class to make my life easier :)


Usage
-----

Let's say you stored JSON strin in a variable called jsonStr, then you can simply parse it as following:

dynamic parsedStr = jsonStr.ParseJSON();
